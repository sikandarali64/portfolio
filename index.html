    <article>Hello! My name is Sikandar Ali. I am a Computer System Engineering student with a strong passion for programming. I have full knowledge of the C language and have also worked on a basic C++ project. Currently, I am learning C++ OOP, web development basics, and Python.

        One of my notable projects is a Hospital Management System in C. Additionally, I have developed a hardware-based Water Level Indicator. I enjoy problem-solving and working on technical projects that enhance my programming skills.
        
        In my free time, I love to relax outdoors and explore new technologies. I believe in continuous learning and aim to expand my expertise in software development.
